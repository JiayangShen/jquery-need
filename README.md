# jQuery NeedJS
*[jQuery NeedJS](https://github.com/JiayangShen/jquery-need), a jQuery plugin that can load JS, CSS files dynamically, and integrated with jQuery Deferred.*

This plugin is based on [jQuery](http://jquery.com), some part code is borrowed form [LazyLoad](https://github.com/rgrove/lazyload).

## Features:

- Loading JS, CSS files into web brwoser dynamically, in demand, in parallel while preserving execution order.
- Integrated with jQuery Deferred, making asynchronous operation callbacks invoking streamline and easier.
- Dynamical noblocking JS loading, no cross domain problem.
- JS can also be set to execute asynchronously.
- By default, it will check whether each JS or CSS file has been loaded, try best to avoid repeating loading. And, you can cancel this default action.

## Browsers Supporting Note:

For old version Firefox, old version Chrome, and Safari, though CSS files can be loaded and execute as expected, callbacks register to jQuery Deferred method such as `done()` won't execute. Because these brwoser don't truly support the `onload` event of the `<link>` DOM element. But if you like, you can fork this repository and fix the bug by yourself.

## APIs

This plugin includes two static methods of the `$` or `jQuery` object: `$.needJS()` and `$.needCSS()`.

### $.needJS(urls, isAsync?, check?)

This method is used to load one or more JS files.
#### Parames:
1. **urls**: URLs of external js files to be loaded. Its type can be `String` or `Array` or `Object`.
2. **isAsync**: Whether to execute JS asynchronously. Optional, can be set to `true` or `false`, default is false, mean to execute JS not asynchronously.
3. **check**: Whether to check each JS file has been loaded or not. Optional, can be set to `true` or `false`, default is false, mean do checking.

### $.needCSS(urls, check?)

This method is used to load one or more CSS files.
#### Parames:
1. **urls**: URLs of external CSS files to be loaded. Its type can be `String` or `Array` or `Object`.
3. **check**: Whether to check each CSS file has been loaded or not. Optional, can be set to `true` or `false`, default is false, mean do checking.

## Usage

Grab the plugin from `release/jquery-need-min.js` and include it in page like this:

```html
<!-- jQuery is required before this plugin -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lib/jquery.min.js"></script>
<!-- include this plugin in page -->
<script type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Then, you can load external JS or CSS files dynamically like this:

```js
$.needJS('far.js')
.done(function()
{
    //far.js has been loaded and executed, you can do some thing...
});
```

The true power of this plugin is, you can coperate the functionality of this plugin with other asynchronous operations that integrated with jQuery Deferred. For example, you want to make a AJAX request while loading a JS file, do something when all of the two asynchronous operations have been finished, like this:

```js
var loadAction = $.needJS('foo.js')
.done(function()
{
    //foo.js has been loaded and executed, you can do some thing...
});

var ajaxAction = $.ajax('/ajax')
.done(function(response)
{
    //ajax request has been successfully finished, and you can do some thing...
});

//$.when() is a jQuery Deferred related static method, included in jQuery itself.
$.when(ajaxAction, loadAction)
.done(function(ajaxResponse)
{
    //foo.js loading and ajax request all have been successfully finished,
    //and you can do some thing...
    /*
    var data = ajaxResponse[0];
    ....
    */
});
```
